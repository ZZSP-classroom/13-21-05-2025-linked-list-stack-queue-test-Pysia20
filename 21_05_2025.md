### Exercise 1: Hospital Queue System

**Description:**  
Implement a queue system to manage patient appointments in a hospital. Patients should be able to be added to the queue, removed when their appointment is done, and viewed in the order they will be seen.

**Requirements:**
- Implement a Queue class with methods: `enqueue`, `dequeue`, and `peek`.
- Ensure the queue works with patient objects that have attributes: `name`, `appointment_time`.
- Write unit tests to verify the order of patients in the queue and that dequeue removes the correct patient.

### Exercise 2: Undo Functionality in a Text Editor

**Description:**  
Create a stack system to manage the undo functionality in a text editor. Each action (typing, deleting) should be pushed onto a stack, and the last action should be popped when undoing.

**Requirements:**
- Implement a Stack class with methods: `push`, `pop`, and `peek`.
- Each stack element should be a string representing a text operation.
- Write unit tests to ensure the stack correctly handles undo operations.

### Exercise 3: Browser History Navigation

**Description:**  
Develop a system to manage browser history using a linked list. Users should be able to navigate forward and backward through their visited pages.

**Requirements:**
- Implement a LinkedList class with methods: `add_page`, `go_back`, `go_forward`.
- Each node should store a URL and a reference to the next and previous nodes.
- Write unit tests to verify navigation through the browser history.

### Exercise 4: Call Center Simulation

**Description:**  
Simulate a call center where calls are managed using a combination of a queue (for incoming calls) and a stack (for calls being processed).

**Requirements:**
- Implement a Queue for incoming calls and a Stack for calls being processed.
- Each call should be an object with attributes: `caller_id`, `time_received`.
- Write unit tests to ensure calls are managed correctly between the queue and stack.

### Exercise 5: Task Scheduler

**Description:**  
Create a task scheduler that manages tasks using a priority queue implemented with a linked list. Tasks should be processed based on priority.

**Requirements:**
- Implement a PriorityQueue class using a linked list, with methods: `add_task`, `process_task`.
- Each task should have attributes: `task_name`, `priority`.
- Write unit tests to ensure tasks are processed in order of priority.

### Exercise 6: Music Playlist Management

**Description:**  
Create a system to manage a music playlist using a linked list. Users should be able to add songs to the playlist, remove songs, and navigate through the playlist.

**Requirements:**
- Implement a `Playlist` class using a linked list, with methods: `add_song`, `remove_song`, `next_song`, `previous_song`.
- Each song should be represented as an object with attributes: `title`, `artist`.
- Write unit tests to ensure the playlist correctly updates when songs are added or removed and that navigation through the playlist works as expected.
